Details for setting up and running project is in README.md file inside ysearch directory.

I have used Youtube API key which I got fee,  youtube allows us to make limited api requests with free API key, so if you got error while running application that might be because of API key limit. To fix it you will need to change API key value YOUTUBE_API_KEY in file /ysearch/ysearch/setting.py.
